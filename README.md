# best-repo-ever
This is the best repo I've ever made.
Why?
Because it's the first one.
It has a lot of "I don't know what I'm doing" features and took a lot of my precious time.
I hope you enjoy it. 
I, personally, would certainly enjoy it more, if I didn't have so little time to complete so many tasks, while maintaing my full time job.
Best wishes,
